# GameBuddy-Verilog

This project is a synthesizable Verilog implementation of an emulator of the original GameBoy. The project is not currently in a functional state, however I am rapidly making progress toward a functioning design.

For more information on this project, please visit [this project's blog page](https://sites.google.com/view/cpe-487/projects).

## Directories

* alias
  * Contains signal aliases for easier debugging capabilities within the waveform viewer
* data
  * Contains miscillaneous information about the project, such as how instructions are grouped for algorithmic decoding or the save states for GTKWave
* logs
  * Contains logs generated by the tools
* rpts
  * Contains test and verification reports
* rtl
  * Contains all Verilog behavioral modelling
* scripts
  * Contains all relevant verification and synthesis scripts
* sim
  * Contains the testbench and all relevant verification models


## Getting Started

To clone this project, run

```
$ git clone https://github.com/grantsimmons/GameBuddy-Verilog.git
```

To run the build and verification flows for this project clone the project, and in the base directory and simply run 
```
$ make
```

### Prerequisites

This project requires:
* Icarus Verilog
* Make
* GTKWave
* Yosys (If running synthesis)

Install all dependencies with
```
$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get install iverilog make gtkwave yosys
```
<!--
### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo
-->

## Running the tests

To run verification with the provided test vectors, simply run ```make``` and view the results of the test in rpts/run.rpt.

To generate test vectors, I use my software emulator, GameBuddy, in its verification mode.

To create your own test vectors from scratch, the test vector format is {OP CODE}\_{A}\_{B}\_{C}\_{D}\_{E}\_{H}\_{L}\_{F}

<!--
### Break down into end to end tests
